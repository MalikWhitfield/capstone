# myHobbi

myHobbi was my original idea that was built with friend and former classmate, Jonah Engelund. myHobbi is a social media application, geared towards people's hobbies. Users have a list of "hobbi" categories, along with their skill level, which ranges from "Just For Fun" to "Advanced". Upon clicking a hobbi, the page will filter their timeline to only posts that have that "hobbiTag". Built using Vue, C Sharp and MySQL
There is an "All Hobbies" Vue, in which users can see a list of every "hobbiTag" ever created within a post. If a user were to click on a hobbiTag, coding, for example, the user would then see all posts with that "coding" hobbiTag.
This project was extremely fun and fulfilling to build and there are still some things I am working to add!
