# myHobbi

myHobbi was my original idea that was built with friend and former classmate, Jonah Engelund. myHobbi is a social media application, geared towards people's hobbies. Users have a list of "hobbi" categories, along with their skill level, which ranges from "Just For Fun" to "Advanced". Upon clicking a hobbi, the page will filter their timeline to only posts that have that "hobbiTag". Built using Vue, C Sharp and MySQL
There is an "All Hobbies" Vue, in which users can see a list of every "hobbiTag" ever created within a post. If a user were to click on a hobbiTag, coding, for example, the user would then see all posts with that "coding" hobbiTag.
For reference, think of a combination between Instagram and Reddit. Or simply, an Instagram with categories.
This project was extremely fun and fulfilling to build and there are still some things I am working to add!

INSPIRATION:
My inspiration to build this app came from me wanting to post my progress as I continue to practice playing the guitar, but feeling like Instagram wasn't quite the right place to constantly post pictures and videos of myself playing the guitar not-too-well.
So, I thought, why not build a social media app in which people can post content more geared towards the things they have an interest in and not just pictures of themselves having a good-time or at different travel destinations? People are addicted to social media anyway, so why not create an environment in which users can post content strictly geared towards their interests, their hobbies? How cool would it be to view another user's profile and watch them progress at their hobbies, whether it's music, dance, coding, cooking, whatever it is? A place in which people can say "Hey, I'm not too good at this, but I want to share anywhere. Let's suck together and eventually, we won't suck anymore." 
Thus, myHobbi was created.
